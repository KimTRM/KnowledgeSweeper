# **KnowledgeSweeper**
This game is just like a normal Minesweeper but it has a twist where if you pick a square with a bomb in it a question will pop up when you answer it correctly you donâ€™t lose a life and you can continue but if answered wrong you lose a life as a consequence.

Every square has a random chance to have a bomb in it or a chest which may give you extra lives. You get 3 lives when you start a game, when all lives are lost it is game over. When you lose a life, a question pops out (the question depends on the subject you choose)

There are different categories:
- Math
- History
- Science
